/**
 * Given two integers N and M, help Monk find an integer X, such that X^2 % M = N and 0 \geq X
 * If there are multiple values of X print smallest one. If there is no possible value of X print 1.
 * 
 * Note: Make sure you handle integer overflow.
 * 
 * Input:
 *  First line consists of a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
 *  Each test case consists of a single line containing two space separated integers denoting N and M.
 * Output:
 *  For each test case print the required answer.
 * Constraints:
 *  1 \leq T \leq 100
 *  0 \leq N < M \leq 10^6
