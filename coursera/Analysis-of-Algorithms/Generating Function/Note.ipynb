    "## Informall Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Let say we have series of \\\\(x\\\\), such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x^0, x^1, x^2, ..., x^n, ...$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Each x in the *power series* above has a *coefficient* \\\\(s\\\\), so that the **coefficients of the power series** are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s_0, s_1, s_2, ..., s_n, ...$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we can conclude that there is a correlation of \\\\(s_i \\rightarrow x^i\\\\)\n",
    "\n",
    "The generating function has main advantage is the power series is a form of **rational number**. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{1-x} = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + ...$$\n",
    "\n",
    "has the form with exist *multiplier coefficients* such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{1-x} = s_0 1 + s_1 x + s_2 x^2 + s_3 x^3 + ...$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is the series of coeffiecients:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$S = 1, 1, 1, 1, ...$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the series \\\\(S\\\\) has generating function (GF) \\\\(\\frac{1}{1-x}\\\\)\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{{1-x}^2} = 1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 4x^2 + ...$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the series of natural nymber \\\\(1, 2, 3, 4, ...\\\\) has generating function \\\\(\\frac{1}{(1-x)^2}\\\\)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Relationship Between GF and Recurrence\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural numbers : \\\\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, ...\\}\\\\) has GF \\\\(\\frac{1}{(1-x)^2} = \\frac{1}{1-2x-x^2}\\\\) and has recurrence \\\\(S_n = 2S{n-1}-S_{n-2}\\\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that relationship more clearly if we rewrite the recurrence in this form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$S_n - 2S_{n-1} + S_{n-2} = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And compute that with the denominator of the GF, namely:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$1-2x+X^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "We normally are interested not just in counting combinatorial structures, but also in analyzing their properties. We look at how to use **bivarite** generative functions for this purpose, and how this relates to the use of **probability** generating functions.\n",

    "## Ordinary Generating Function (OGF)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a sequence \\\\(a_0, a_1, a_2, ..., a_k, ...\\\\), the function\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A(z) = \\sum_{k \\geq 0} a_k z^k$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is called the *Ordinary Generating Function (OGF)* of the sequence. We used notation the notation \\\\(\\lfloor z^k \\rfloor A(z)\\\\) to refer to the coefficuent \\\\(a_k\\\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given generating functions \\\\(A(z) = \\sum_{k \\geq 0} a_k z^k\\\\) and \\\\(B(z) = \\sum_{k \\geq 0} b_k z^k\\\\) that represent the sequence \\\\(\\{a_0, a_1, ..., a_k, ...\\}\\\\) and \\\\(\\{b_0, b_1, ... , b_k, ...\\}\\\\), respectively, we can perform a number of simple transformations to get generating functions for other sequences. Several such operations are show is Table 2. Example of the apllication of these operations may be found in the relationships among the entries in Table 1.\n",
