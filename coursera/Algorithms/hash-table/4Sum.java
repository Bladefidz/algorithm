 * 4-SUM.
 * Given an array a[] of n integers, the 4-SUM problem is to determine
 * if there exist distinct indices i, j, k, and l such that
 * a[i]+a[j]=a[k]+a[l].
 * Design an algorithm for the 4-SUM problem that takes time proportional to
 * n^2 (under suitable technical assumptions).
 *
 * create a hash table with 2Cn key-value pairs
