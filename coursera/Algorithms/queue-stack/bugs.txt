# Test on RandomizedQueue
Test 9: create two nested iterators over the same randomized queue
  * n = 10
    - outer iterator failed to return one (or more) of the 10 items
    - outer iterator returned the same item more than once

  * n = 50
    - outer iterator failed to return one (or more) of the 50 items
    - outer iterator returned the same item more than once

==> FAILED
Test 10: create two parallel iterators over the same randomized queue
  * n = 10
    - two iterators return the same sequence of values
    - they should return the same set of values but in a
      different order

  * n = 50
    - two iterators return the same sequence of values
    - they should return the same set of values but in a
      different order

==> FAILED
