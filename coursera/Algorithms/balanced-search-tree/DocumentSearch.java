/**
 * Document search.
 * Design an algorithm that takes a sequence of n document words
 * and a sequence of m query words
 * and find the shortest interval in which the m query words appear
 * in the document in the order given.
 * The length of an interval is the number of words in that interval.
 *
 * for each word, maintain a sorted list of the indices in the document in
 * which that word appears.
 * Scan through the sorted lists of the query words in a judicious manner.
