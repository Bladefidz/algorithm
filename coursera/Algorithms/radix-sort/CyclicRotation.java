 * Two strings s and t are cyclic rotations of one another if they have
 * the same length and s consists of a suffix of t followed by a prefix of t.
 * For example, "suffixsort" and "sortsuffix" are cyclic rotations.
 *
 * Given n distinct strings, each of length L, design an algorithm to
 * determine whether there exists a pair of distinct strings that are cyclic
 * rotations of one another. For example, the following list of n=12 strings
 * of length L=10 contains exactly one pair of strings
 * ("suffixsort" and "sortsuffix") that are cyclic rotations of one another.

 *
 * The order of growth of the running time should be nL^2 (or better) in the
 * worst case. Assume that the alphabet size R is a small constant.

 * Signing bonus. Do it in NnL time in the worst case.
