/**
 * Generalized queue.
 * Design a generalized queue data type that supports all of the following
 * operations in logarithmic time (or better) in the worst case.
 * 		Create an empty data structure.
 * 		Append an item to the end of the queue.
 * 		Remove an item from the front of the queue.
 * 		Return the i-th item in the queue.
 * 		Remove the i-th item from the queue.
 *
 * Create a red–black BST where the keys are integers
 * and the values are the items such that the i-th largest integer key in the
 * red–black BST corresponds to the i-th item in the queue.
