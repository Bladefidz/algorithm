/**
 * A taxicab number is an integer that can be expressed as
 * the sum of two cubes of positive integers in two different ways:
 * a^3 + b^3 = c^3 + d^3.
 *
 * For example,
 * 1729 is the smallest taxicab number:
 * 9^3 + 10^3 = 1^3 + 12^3.
 *
 * Design an algorithm to find all taxicab numbers less than n.
 */

/**
 * Version 1
 * Use time proportional to n2log⁡n and space proportional to n2.
 * Form the sums a^3+b^3 and sort.
